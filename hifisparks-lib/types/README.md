### Type Definitions

## Controls

TODO: this needs to be cleared up a bit

## Hardware

Type and interface definitions are kept together to make sure they are consistent between different implementations.
These are used by hifisparks-iron only, but `Config` types will be needed later on in the UI if it'll be possible to configure hifispark-iron via a user interface.
