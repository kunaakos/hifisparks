### ðŸš§ KEEP IT RELAXED BUT SMART IN HERE ðŸš§

The client side can be a bit chaotic for now, as it's not clear how it will be structured or even what it will look like. So keep it simple, file structure flat, type defs together with components, reuse as much as possible and don't give a hoot about performance, focus on code that will be easier to modify later. If something good emerges, move it to `hifisparks-lib/components`.
